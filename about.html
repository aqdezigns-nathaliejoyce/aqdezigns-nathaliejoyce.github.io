        <h1>Nathalie Joyce (they/she) is...</h1>
        <hr>
            <p>A queer bilingual curanderx descended from a long lineage of Afro-Cuban healers and Gallega intuitives. Their work is guided by ancestral wisdom, contemplative training, Earth based spirituality, and clinical social work education.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Nat's magic comes most alive with clients that are transforming their intimate relationships, liberating intergenerational patterns of oppression, and reconnecting with embodied joy. Nathalie loves guiding relationships through liminal realms such as birth, illness, gender transition, uncoupling, and opening. They find that deep relational healing can be found in these entre mundo spaces.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Nat's current embodied healing offerings are informed by their ancestral plant medicine studies and Earth based spiritual tradition. They also weave these studies and wisdom into their community healing justice work. Nathalie is known to bring joy, love, and a fierce commitment to liberation in their work. Nathalie currently lives and practices on unceded Nonotuck and Nipmuc land.</p>
